It's Motley.
    This is a motley collection of scripts that provision google apps accounts.
    They are (so far) all written in python, so in theory they should be able
    to run on any OS...but we're only testing in Linux at this point.

Dependencies
    You need Google's Python API library:
    http://code.google.com/p/gdata-python-client/downloads/list

    If you can do the following, then you should be in good shape:
    $ python
    Python 2.5.2 (r252:60911, Jul 22 2009, 15:35:03) 
    >>> import gdata.apps.service
    >>>

Provisioning from Active Directory or a database
    If you want to provision accounts from an Active Directory (or other LDAP
    directory), or from a database, then see provision.py.

    If you want to set this up to run regularly, you might put something like
    the following in your crontab (assuming you copy these scripts into
    /usr/local/bin/vla-google-apps-provisioning ):
    0 0 * * * /usr/local/bin/vla-google-apps-provisioning/provision.py | logger -t google_apps_provisioning

Provisioning from Somewhere Else
    You might take a look at vlagoogleprovisionlib.py.

No Magic
    There is no magic here. There isn't even sophistication. But since lots of
    people need to do the same basic thing, maybe this will be useful to
    someone.
